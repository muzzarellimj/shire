# Shire

Shire is an open source personal project management platform with a simple mission: seamless aggregation. It is inspired
by a lack of existing software that fits the requirements of an endeavor of mine - purchasing a home - and keeping 
track of all the paperwork, purchases, and planning that goes along with it. Shire is built with 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and is written primarily in 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
